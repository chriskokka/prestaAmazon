prestaZon

This is a REST API Java module meant for updating Prestashops items automatically through
AWS product advertising API.

The format of the output info about the products can easily be changed
to be XML / JSON or just plain text, so this module can be used for
other E-commerce solutions also.

Java module and the API are built using the Play Framework 2.1
